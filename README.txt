# CIS-435-Blackjack
Project 4 for CIS 435 web development



Things to consider/accomplish:
-User interface mock up
-A UML diagram 


Notes to remember for the project:
-The dealer hits until a soft 17 (meaning an ace is counting as 11)
-Lets figure out if we want to make the deck shuffle (like when to shuffle)
-Do we want to add in split and double
-We have to add in minimum and maximum bets
-Add in bonus for if the player gets Blackjack from the first two cards
-We have to decide if the dealer will check for blackjack

How to play Blackjack:
-The player is just trying to beat the dealer, closest to 21 without going over wins.
-The player can stop hitting (asking for cards) at whatever point they want
-The dealer must hit until their total is 17 or higher
-The dealer only shows one of their cards face up
-The player gets blackjack if they get an Ace and a 10/face card in their first two cards
